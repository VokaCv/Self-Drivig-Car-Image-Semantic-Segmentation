# Self-Drivig-Car-Image-Semantic-Segmentation


## Introduction

Here is an example of creating an AI model for on-board computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles. The system being designed is composed of the following parts:

1. Acquisition of images in real time.
2. Image processing.
3. Image segmentation.
4. Decision system.

In this repository we focus on 3.'Image segmentation' part. The goal will be to design a first image segmentation model that should be easily integrated into the fully embedded IoT system.

## Dataset

The model is creted and tested on [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/)

## Metrics


## Image transformation


## Unet Model

  ### Transfer Learning
  

## Results


## Flaask Rest API
The model is deployed as endpoint on Azure, via simple Flask webpage
